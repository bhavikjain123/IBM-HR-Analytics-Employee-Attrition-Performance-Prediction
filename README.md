**IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Prediction**

**Introduction:**
This repository contains code for predicting employee attrition and performance using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, which includes various attributes related to employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and performance ratings.

**Dataset:**
The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle or any other reputable source. It consists of a CSV file named "WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv".

**Requirements:**
To run the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- imbalanced-learn

**Instructions:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset and place it in the repository directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code.
4. Run each cell or execute the script to perform dataset analysis, preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and optimization.
5. View the results and insights obtained from the analysis.
6. Optionally, modify the code or experiment with different machine learning algorithms or optimization techniques to further improve model performance.
